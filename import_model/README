Put a folder in this directory with an obj file called 'stadium.obj' and a mtl file 'stadium.mtl' (I'm hardcoding the file paths for no good reason and dealing with stadiums currently)
Switch the OBJImport at the end of the file to that folder.
Run import.py, a c3 file named out will be created in that folder.
Shadows are weird, there's some hacky logic in the shadowType method of TextureGroup that you might need to play with.
This assumes you have the Wiimms tools on your path (specifically wimgt)
